/*
? We use objects to describe real world features
? Objects can contain properties and methods
? Objects are self contained  blocks of code
? Objects are building blocks of an application
? This kind of paradigm was developed to make the code easier to maintain


~ CLASSES
! Classes  are like a blueprint from which we can create objects, it itself is not an object.

~ INSTANCES
! An instance is a real object that we can use in our code, which was created from a class.

~ FOUR FUNDAMENTALS OF OOPS
? ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, INHERITANCE, POLYMORPHISM

~ ABSTRACTION
! And abstraction basically means to ignore or to hide details that don't matter. This allows us to get an overview perspective of whatever it is that we're implementing instead of messing with details that don't really matter to our implementation.

~ ENCAPSULATION
! The process making the methods of a class private so that they cannot be accessed outside of a class. Some methods can be accessed outside as a public interface.

~ INHERITANCE
! Child class that extends the parent class, inherits some features from the parent class. So inheritance is a process of making all properties and methods of a certain class accessible to the child class.

~ POLYMORPHISM
! This means that a child class can overwrite a method that it inherited from a parent class.

// Coding Challenge #2

/* 
1. Re-create challenge 1, but this time using an ES6 class;
2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide by 1.6);
3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6);
4. Create a new car and experiment with the accelerate and brake methods, and with the getter and setter.

// Coding Challenge #3

/* 
1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called EV) as a CHILD "class" of Car. Besides a make and current speed, the EV also has the current battery charge in % ('charge' property);
2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument 'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo';
3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20, and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140 km/h, with a charge of 22%';
4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate', 'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when you 'accelerate'! HINT: Review the definiton of polymorphism ðŸ˜‰
