// values are of two types, primitive and object. Inside an object, all values are non primitive, rest everywhere, values are primitive.

// There are seven primitive data types. Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined(value taken by variable that is not yet defined), Symbol(ES2015, a value that is unique and cannot be changed), BigInt (ES2020, used to store large integers that Numbers cannot store)

// typeof is a operator that will return the datatype

const lucky = "Lucky"

console.log(typeof lucky) // string will be printed
